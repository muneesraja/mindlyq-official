Plan of action:

1. Fix the Untitled issue for remainder creation agent and modification agent, currently the remainder description is creation is fine, but most of the time the remainder title is "Untitled reminder". Our agent should always make meaningful naming for the title.
example: 
This is current implementation storing title:
- ðŸ”„ "Untitled reminder" - Mar 9 12:10 PM
   Time to cook the mid-brunch! Enjoy!
- ðŸ”„ "Untitled reminder" - Mar 9 12:12 PM
   Time to cook the mid-brunch! Get cooking!
What we wanted is:
- ðŸ”„ "Cook mid-brunch" - Mar 9 12:10 PM
   Time to cook the mid-brunch! Enjoy!
- ðŸ”„ "Cook mid-brunch" - Mar 9 12:12 PM
   Time to cook the mid-brunch! Get cooking!

2. Make the modification agent smart, similar to creation agent.

3 (Deprecated). Create a response agent which will handle the response, It should be similar to intent detection agent which handles the response from LLM and returns a proper response to the user. It should be the only agent or function that sends response to the user, basically this will make our architecture more modular and easier to maintain also while responding messages should be always be friendly and helpful.

4. Multiple remainder creation agent which creates remainder is bulk, it can re-use most of our implementation on create and modification agent, for 
example:
- set standup meeting remainder on following date 10 AM: 10th, 12th and 14th.
- set two reminders that I'm starting to chennai by tomorrow 6 PM and my return flight is at 11 PM 15th of March
...the possibility can be endless

5. Fix the listing agent, currently the listing agent is throwing error for listing only recurring remainders. We need to analyse the schema of remainders and provide clear context/instruction to listing agent, so that this error could be avoided in the future. The listing agent should be most intelligent as it needs to handle and create query as per user's request, it should clearly know what query it can write and if it can't write the query, it should return a proper response to the user. It should always know the column names of the schema so most of the issues can be avoided.

Prompt provided by user:
list only non recurring remainders

Error:
