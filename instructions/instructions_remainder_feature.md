# Project overview
Our goal is to build a next.js app that uses WhatsApp API to send and manage reminders. The app should have the following features, some of the features are already implemented, if required make modification of those files/structure/flow:

- Set reminders using everyday language
- The ai should be able to communicate with the user using everyday language,
ex: If a user says Hi, the ai should respond with "Hi too!", but once the user says "Remind me to call John in 5 minutes", the ai should understand this and respond with "Remind me to call John in 5 minutes" directly.
- Automatic time zone handling, if a user from india says "Remind me in a minute, it should understand the timezone and create a remainder for the correct time in india"
- Should use Google's gemini AI to generate responses and send them back to the user.
- We will be using twilio to send and receive messages over whatsapp
- Flexible reminder parsing
- Recurring reminder support
- Real-time notifications via WhatsApp
- Whenever a user sets a reminder, our Ai should store something like:
first part it can be creative where it can say, 
First part: Generated by the Ai:"hey this is your reminder for the walk."
Second part: the actual reminder ex: Your remainder description: "Remind me to walk at 10:30 am"

# Core functionalities
## 1. Input parsing

- Automatic time zone handling, if a user from india says "Remind me in a minute, it should understand the timezone and create a remainder for the correct time in india"
- Should use Google's gemini AI to generate responses and send them back to the user.
- Flexible reminder parsing
- Recurring reminder support
  - Non recurring reminders example: a user can say "Remind me to walk at 10:30 am" and the ai should understand this and create a recurring reminder for the correct time
  - Recurring reminders example: "Set weekly reminder for team meeting on Monday at 10am"

## 2. Parsing and setting remainder in DB

- Whenever a user sets a reminder, our Ai should store message something like this:
first part it can be creative where it can say, 
First part: Generated by the Ai:"hey this is your reminder for the walk."
Second part: the actual reminder ex: Your remainder description: "Remind me to walk at 10:30 am"
So combined it should look like:
`hey this is your reminder for the walk.
Your remainder description: Remind me to walk at 10:30 am`

## 3. Sending notifications to the user
- A CRON will run through our DB every minute and send notifications to the user

# Important Implementation Notes

Memorization implementation:
We are going to implement something like a memorization, where a user sends this "set a remainder on Feb 4 to have a call with amber" but didn't added any time with it, in this case our model should keep this in memory and raise next question with okay what is the time or something which it can be creative, nothing should be hard coded
