# MindlyQ Changelog - Version 5.4

## Version 5.4 - Recurring Reminders with End Dates
*Released: 2025-03-13*

### Overview
This update introduces the ability to set end dates for recurring reminders, allowing users to specify when a recurring reminder should stop triggering. This enhancement improves the reminder management experience by automatically handling the expiration of recurring reminders.

### New Features
- **End Date for Recurring Reminders**: Users can now specify an end date when creating recurring reminders
- **Automatic Expiration**: Recurring reminders will automatically stop triggering after their end date has passed
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added validation to ensure end dates are in the future and after the due date

### Technical Changes

#### Database Changes
- Added `end_date` field to the `Reminder` model in the Prisma schema
- Updated Prisma client with new type definitions for the `end_date` field

#### Agent Updates
- **ReminderCreationAgent**:
  - Updated the `REMINDER_CREATION_PROMPT` to include end date information
  - Modified the `ReminderCreationResponse` interface to include the `end_date` field
  - Enhanced reminder creation logic to handle and validate end dates for recurring reminders

- **BulkReminderCreationAgent**:
  - Updated the `BULK_REMINDER_CREATION_PROMPT` to include end date information
  - Modified the response interface to include the `end_date` field
  - Added validation for end dates in bulk reminder creation

#### Cron Service Updates
- Updated the `isReminderDue` function to check if a recurring reminder has passed its end date
- Modified database queries for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reminders to filter out reminders that have passed their end date
- Added logging for reminders that are skipped due to reaching their end date

#### Date Handling
- Updated the `toUTC` function in the date-converter utility to require a timezone parameter for consistent UTC conversion
- Ensured all date handling follows the established UTC storage pattern

#### TypeScript Improvements
- Created custom type definitions in `prisma-extensions.d.ts` to properly type the new `end_date` field
- Added type assertions where needed to maintain type safety

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to the new `end_date` field in various components
- Ensured proper validation of end dates to prevent invalid reminder creation

### Implementation Notes
- All dates continue to be stored in UTC format in the database
- End dates are validated to ensure they are after the due date for recurring reminders
- The cron service now checks end dates before processing reminders

### Future Considerations
- Add UI elements to allow users to modify end dates for existing recurring reminders
- Implement notifications to inform users when recurring reminders are about to expire
- Consider adding recurrence patterns with more complex rules (e.g., "every other week")
